# HypervisorsDetection
This is the first software system, which can detect a stealthy hypervisor and calculate several nested ones even under countermeasures.

Details are in my paper:
Korkin, I. (2015, May 18-21). Two Challenges of Stealthy Hypervisors Detection: Time Cheating and Data Fluctuations. Paper presented at the Proceedings of the 10th Annual Conference on Digital Forensics, Security and Law (CDFSL), 33-57, Daytona Beach, Florida, USA.
